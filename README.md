# mailchump

Web API service to send email. If you have your own Linux server you don't have to spend a lot of money paying some web service to do it for you. The hardest part is getting DKIM and SPF configured for your server but that's outside the scope of this API. At its core, this little program is no different than using Rust to do what everyone did in the 90s to use sendmail to send and receive email to and from anyone.
